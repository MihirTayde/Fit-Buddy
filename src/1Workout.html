                1. Starting Position: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, arms at your sides. <br>
                2. Squat Down: Bend your knees and lower your body into a squat position, keeping your back straight and chest up. <br> 
                3. Placing Hands: Place your hands on the ground in front of you, just outside your feet. <br>
                4. Kick Feet Back: Quickly kick your feet back so that you're in a plank position, with your body in a straight line from head to heels. Engage your core muscles to maintain stability. <br>
                5. Perform Push-Up (Optional): Lower your chest towards the ground by bending your elbows, performing a push-up if desired. Keep your body in a straight line throughout the movement. <br>
                6. Jump Feet Forward: Jump your feet back towards your hands, returning to the squat position. <br>
                7. Jump Up: Explosively jump up into the air, reaching your arms overhead. <br>
                8. Land Softly: Land softly on the balls of your feet, bending your knees to absorb the impact. <br>
                9. Repeat: Immediately go back into the next repetition by descending into another squat and continuing the sequence.

        <div class="container">
            <img src="Images/Body weight images/QHDS.gif" alt="Calf raise" class="h-10 w-40">
            <div class="text-left">
                Calf raises are a simple yet effective exercise for strengthening the muscles in your calves. Here's how to perform a basic calf raise: <br><br>
                1. Starting Position: Stand tall with your feet hip-width apart, arms at your sides or hands on your hips for balance. <br>
                2. Lift Heels: Slowly raise your heels off the ground by pushing through the balls of your feet, lifting your body upward as high as possible. <br>
                3. Contract Calf Muscles: Squeeze your calf muscles at the top of the movement, emphasizing the contraction. <br>
                4. Hold: Hold the raised position for a moment to maximize muscle engagement. <br>
                5. Lower Heels: Slowly lower your heels back down to the starting position, maintaining control throughout the movement. <br>
                6. Repeat: Perform the exercise for the desired number of repetitions. <br><br>
                Tips for Performing Calf Raises: <br><br>
                Keep your core engaged and maintain good posture throughout the exercise. <br>
                Avoid using momentum to lift your heels; focus on using the muscles in your calves. <br>
                Perform the exercise in a slow and controlled manner for optimal results. <br>
                To increase the challenge, you can perform calf raises on an elevated surface (e.g., a step) to increase the range of motion.

    <h1 class="text-white text-center underline">Lunges</h1>
    <section>
        <div class="container">
            <img src="Images/Body weight images/UCTS.gif" alt="Lunges" class="h-10 w-40">
            <div class="text-left">
                Lunges are a fantastic exercise for targeting multiple muscle groups in the lower body, including the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves. Here's how to perform a basic forward lunge: <br> <br>
                1. Starting Position: Stand tall with your feet hip-width apart, arms at your sides. <br>
                2. Step Forward: Take a large step forward with your right foot, ensuring that your knee is directly above your ankle and your thigh is parallel to the ground. Your left knee should be bent, with your left heel lifted off the ground. <br>
                3. Lower Your Body: Slowly lower your body straight down by bending both knees until your back knee nearly touches the ground. Keep your torso upright and your chest lifted. <br>
                4. Push Back Up: Push through your right heel to return to the starting position, straightening your right leg as you stand back up. <br>
                5. Switch Legs: Repeat the movement on the opposite side by stepping forward with your left foot and performing a lunge. <br>
                6. Alternate Legs: Continue alternating legs for the desired number of repetitions or time. <br> <br>
                Tips for Performing Lunges: <br> <br>
                Keep your core engaged and your back straight throughout the movement to maintain stability and prevent injury. <br>
                Ensure that your front knee stays aligned with your ankle and does not extend beyond your toes to protect your knee joint. <br>
                Lower your body down until your back knee is just above the ground, but avoid resting it on the ground to maintain tension in your muscles. <br>
                Keep your gaze forward and your chest lifted to help with balance and posture. <br>
                To increase the challenge, you can hold dumbbells in each hand or perform walking lunges by stepping forward with each lunge instead of returning to the starting position between repetitions. <br>
                Incorporate lunges into your workout routine to build strength, improve balance, and tone your lower body muscles.
